**AscentViewer** is a powerful **image viewer** written in **Python** using [**PyQT**](https://riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/) and [**several other libraries.**](other/markdown/CREDITS.md)

Here is [**its website**](https://dd.acrazytown.com/AscentViewer/).

## What happened to DDIV?

DDIV got renamed to "**AscentViewer**".

The main reason for that is that [**DespawnedDiamond**](https://github.com/despawnedd) (the owner) is not the only one working on it anymore, and the second reason is that "AscentViewer" just sounds cooler!

Looking for old, pre-rename code? Check out the [**"pre-rename" branch.**](https://github.com/despawnedd/AscentViewer/tree/pre-rename)

## Version naming info

### Version Structure (a.b.c-bld-rev_rl)

> *Notice: **This section might and probably will change in the near future.***

"**a**" is the **major version** number (e.g. "**1.0.0**").

"**b**" is the **minor version** number (e.g. "**1.3.0**").

"**c**" is the **match version** number (e.g. "**1.3.8**").

"**bld**" is the **build version** number (e.g. "**1.3.8-201204**") (*The build number's pretty much the date the "build" was made in, formatted like this: last two digits of the  year + month + day*).

"**rev**" is the **revision number** of that build. This will only be used in cases that there are several builds in on day. (e.g. "**1.3.8-201204-4**").

"**rl**" is the **release branch** indicator (eg. "**1.3.8-201204-4_master**")
