# DespawnedDiamond's Image Viewer (DDIV)

**DespawnedDiamond's Image Viewer**, **DDIV** for short, is an **image viewer** program written in **Python**. It's based on [this Tkinter tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zg4c92pNFeo), and [many other resources](/CREDITS.md).

DDIV's successor, AscentViewer is available here: [AscentViewer's GitHub Page](https://github.com/despawnedd/AscentViewer).
It is written using C# and XAML instead of Python for a cleaner and better user experience.

Requirements: 
- [PIL/Pillow (ImageTk, Image functions)](https://github.com/python-pillow/Pillow)
- [resizeimage/python-resize-image](https://github.com/VingtCinq/python-resize-image)
